    <h1>Degrees of Decline: Visualising Earth’s Warming and Biodiversity Loss</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      A planet in change. As global temperatures climb higher than ever recorded, wildlife populations are plummeting. 
      This interactive data story visualises how a warming world reshapes life on Earth — from shrinking mammal habitats 
      to the sharp decline in global biodiversity.
    </p>

    <!-- ========== Visualisation 1 ========== -->
    <div class="vis-block">
      <h2>1. Global Mammal Distribution Map</h2>
      <div id="mammal_map" class="chart"></div>
      <p class="note">
        This map visualises the combined marine and terrestrial ranges of mammals using the
        Equal-Earth projection, which preserves relative area for fairer visual comparison across
        continents and oceans. It’s relevant to this site’s story because it grounds the climate-and-
        biodiversity narrative in <em>place</em>: where species actually live, migrate, and overlap with
        human activity. Hover to reveal detailed attributes from the source dataset (species/range
        properties, status fields, and more). Seeing the spatial footprint of mammals helps explain
        why warming oceans, shifting coastlines, and habitat fragmentation directly translate into
        population declines shown in the Living Planet Index charts below.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ========== Visualisation 2 ========== -->
    <div class="vis-block">
      <h2>2. Global Temperature Anomalies (1850 – 2025)</h2>
      <div id="anomalies" class="chart"></div>
      <p class="note">
        This chart tracks how Earth’s average land–ocean temperature has shifted since 1850, showing
        both the yearly fluctuations (blue line) and a smoothed 10-year trend (red line). The single slider
        lets you interactively explore how the climate evolved through industrialisation, the post-war boom,
        and the present-day acceleration. The continuous rise above the 0 °C baseline—and toward the
        1.5 °C Paris Agreement limit—illustrates the rapid pace of anthropogenic warming. This matters
        because even small average increases drive extreme events, biodiversity loss, and feedback loops
        that appear in later visualisations of species decline.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ========== Visualisation 3 ========== -->
    <div class="vis-block">
      <h2>3. Decadal Average Temperature Anomalies</h2>
      <div id="decadeBar" class="chart"></div>
      <p class="note">
        Each bar summarises the average global temperature anomaly for a decade, coloured on a
        red–blue scale centred at 0 °C. The pattern is stark: decades before the mid-20th century
        are mostly below the long-term average (blue), while every decade since the 1980s shows
        sustained warming (deepening red). This isn’t just a visual trend—it represents a structural
        shift in the climate system driven by greenhouse gases. Warmer baseline decades elevate the
        frequency and intensity of heatwaves, droughts and marine heat spikes, which in turn reduce
        habitat quality and resilience. In later visuals, the Living Planet Index heatmap shows how
        these pressures align with widespread biodiversity decline, particularly for regions already
        stressed by habitat fragmentation and warming oceans.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ========== Visualisation 4 ========== -->
    <div class="vis-block">
      <h2>4. Global Living Planet Index (1970 = 1)</h2>
      <div id="lpi_chart" class="chart"></div>
      <p class="note">
        The Living Planet Index (LPI) tracks the relative abundance of vertebrate populations worldwide,
        normalised to 1970 = 100. Use the single slider to set a start year and explore how quickly
        biodiversity has declined since the 1970s. The steady drop from ~100 to ~40–60 in recent years
        means that monitored populations are, on average, less than two-thirds of their 1970 levels.
        This matters for climate and habitats: warmer baseline decades increase heat extremes and
        ecosystem stress, while land-use change and warming oceans reduce habitat quality and recovery
        capacity. Read together with the temperature anomaly charts above, the LPI shows how a warming
        climate coincides with widespread biodiversity loss, especially in regions where fragmentation
        and marine heatwaves compound the pressure.
      </p>
    </div>
    <!-- ========== Visualisation 5 ========== -->
    <div class="vis-block">
      <h2>5. Living Planet Index Heatmap by Region</h2>
      <div id="heatmap_lpi" class="chart"></div>
      <p class="note">
        This heatmap compares how vertebrate populations have changed across regions from 1970 onwards, 
        where darker red shades represent a greater decline in biodiversity and lighter or green shades 
        indicate stability or recovery. The consistent red hues across many regions highlight the global 
        nature of biodiversity loss, showing that few ecosystems are untouched. As animal populations 
        shrink and species vanish, habitats lose key ecological functions — such as pollination, soil 
        regeneration, and carbon storage — leading to cascading effects on ecosystems and human wellbeing. 
        These declines are strongly linked to climate change, deforestation, and habitat fragmentation, 
        as seen in earlier visualisations showing global warming trends.
